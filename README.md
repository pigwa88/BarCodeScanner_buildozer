Hi There!
I want to compile a simple barcode scanning app using the phone's camera via Kivy. Unfortunately, Buildozer crashes every time, and it's hard for me to identify the issue. 
Can someone help me?  I'm using the latest Python 3.12 and WSL (Ubuntu-22.04).
The entire Python app code, buildozer.spec, and logs are available in my repository. This looks like a buildozer problem.
